                <p>There are artifacts, relics, and symbols that might offer a chance—however small.
                    This is a survival kit that could save your skin… or damn you just as easily.
                    Therefore, it must be used with caution.
                    What follows is a list of items, ordered by increasing level of danger. </p>

                        <h3>Ring with the Elder Sign</h3>
                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Elder Sign.png">
                        <p>The Elder Sign is one of the oldest, most effective, and most enigmatic tools any occult investigator should carry. Sometimes it appears as a five-pointed star with a flaming eye at its center; other times, it resembles an elongated branch-like shape.
                            The Elder Sign acts as a protective seal, proving especially effective against certain specific horrors—such as Deep Ones, Byakhee, the formless spawn of Tsathoggua, and other creatures belonging to the lesser races.
                            To them, it functions as a field of repulsion. While not an invulnerable barrier, it prevents them from approaching during those first critical seconds—the ones that determine whether you escape or not.
                            Though wearing it as a ring is highly practical, the Elder Sign has also been used drawn in chalk on the ground, carved in stone, worn around the neck, and in many other forms. Experts recommend placing it above doorways when ritual activity is suspected nearby.
                            Others, more extreme, have it tattooed onto their skin, believing it makes their soul less visible to those who feed upon it.
                            But it must not be forgotten that possession is not enough—the key lies in activation. Its effectiveness greatly increases when drawn while a very specific protective litany is recited.</p>

                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Reliquary of Dagon.png">
                        <p>A small coffer adorned with unknown symbols, within which lies a black pearl said to pulse with a cold, ethereal light at its core.
                            The relic allows its bearer to be perceived by the Deep Ones as one of their kind, even granting the ability to breathe underwater without difficulty.
                            However, handling the pearl with bare hands is strongly discouraged.
                            Some who have done so experienced immediate visions of impossible abysses; others forgot how to breathe in air, and there are reports of individuals who lost their native languages—able only to speak in the Deep Ones' guttural tongue.</p>

                    <section id="Bowl-of-K’n-Yan">
                        <h3>Bowl of K’n-Yan</h3>
                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Bowl of K’n-Yan.png">
                        <p>Originating from the subterranean city of K’n-Yan, this black obsidian bowl serves as a tool for mental revelation.
                            When filled with a thick, reddish, viscous liquid, the bowl allows the drinker to access ancestral memories—but these are not human memories. They are fragments of history lived by elder races long before mankind.
                            To drink from the bowl is to absorb experiences far beyond human comprehension: seeing colors that do not exist, smelling impossible scents, hearing thoughts born from multidimensional minds.
                            Often, one feels the overwhelming presence of something watching from beyond time itself.
                            The ritual demands absolute solitude, prolonged fasting, and a prayer spoken in a forgotten dialect.
                            The effects vary depending on the mental resilience of the drinker. Some enter trances, others convulse; a rare few attain higher understanding—while some never wake again.

                        <h3>Keys of Gugael</h3>
                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Keys of Gugael.png">
                        <p>The Keys of Gugael have no fixed form and are not entirely physical in nature. Some claim to have seen them as small metallic pieces that vibrate in the dark; others describe them as classic keys, etched with fractals at the tip—patterns only perceivable in altered states of consciousness.
                            These keys are said to unlock thresholds sealed by ancient entities, dimensional traps, or gateways to planes where time bends upon itself.
                            In theory, they could even open the gates that keep Cthulhu imprisoned in R’lyeh.
                            In the right hands, they might serve to escape impossible situations—magically sealed chambers, temporal tunnels, or dream prisons.
                            But as we well know, every portal is bidirectional, and one cannot always choose what comes in or goes out.
                            To use them without proper preparation is to risk unleashing the contents of a cosmic sarcophagus.</p>

                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Lens of Yith.png">
                        <p>This lens, forged with an impossibly polyhedral geometry, allows the observer to glimpse timelines both past and future—thereby slightly altering the course of the present.
                            It is not a means of predicting the future, but rather of perceiving a convergence of probabilities, offering the user a degree of choice.
                            Using the lens requires strict mental preparation. The user must enter a deep meditative state and focus their intent.
                            If the connection is made, the lens reveals projections of lives that could have been—or that might yet be.
                            Some interpret these visions as warnings; others experience them as temptations.
                            In any case, the perception of time becomes fragmented, dreams echo with alternate paths, and déjà vu turns into a relentless storm.</p>

                        <h3>Clay Horror</h3>
                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Clay Horror.png">
                        <p>Figures carved from black stone, basalt, or jade depict the likeness of Cthulhu. Those who possess them begin to suffer from nightmares of sunken cities, chants in inhuman tongues, and an oppressive sensation that something ancient is about to awaken.
                            Attempts to destroy or abandon these figures have proven futile—they always return. Some researchers have used the statuettes to predict Cthulhu’s oneiric activity and that of his followers.
                            When the figure begins to emit heat, vibrate imperceptibly, or disturb the bearer’s sleep with intense nightmares, it is often a sign that an active cult is attempting to awaken the Great Old One.
                            Furthermore, in certain conditions and with proper mental training, one can channel these visions into a state of lucid dreaming, from which the bearer may explore the sunken city of R’lyeh without losing their sanity.</p>

                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Chaugnar Faugn Amulet.png">
                        <p>Forged from ancient stone and inscribed with runes impossible to classify, the amulet attunes its bearer to the presence of Chaugnar Faugn. Through this connection, the wearer may walk among His servants undetected—and even resist His influence for a brief time.
                            However, the cost is steep. The essence of Chaugnar Faugn slowly seeps into the bearer, and over time, the user may begin to undergo physical changes: hardening of the skin, and even the growth of inhuman limbs.</p>

                        <h3>Breviary of the Ponape Manuscript</h3>
                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Breviary of the Ponape Manuscript.png">
                        <p>The Ponape Manuscript is a fragmentary work attributed to long-lost Oceanic cultures from forgotten ages. It was discovered by Captain Abner Ezekiel Hoag in 1734, though its true origins trace back to pre-human civilizations—linked to Atlantis and the Deep Ones.
                            It identifies with uncanny precision locations such as the sunken city of Y’ha-nthlei and R’lyeh itself.
                            The Ponape passage is not merely a ceremonial guide. Some sections are true protocols for communicating with underwater entities whose names remain forbidden even among the most seasoned cultists.
                            There are portions that resemble invocations, others that sound like prayers of submission, and still others that are astral maps only decipherable during dream-states.
                            Though the known translations—partial and incomplete—have been used by modern cults to attempt the awakening of Cthulhu’s servitors, they may also be used to do the opposite.
                            Thus, possessing a breviary containing the most appropriate spells for such cases would not be unwise.
                            However, be warned: merely reading a single passage from the manuscripts places you within the awareness of these entities—and their agents.

                        <h3>Shard of the Leng Crystal</h3>
                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Shard of the Leng Crystal.png">
                        <p>This translucent crystal, brought from the Plateau of Leng, acts as a window to other worlds. To activate it, it must be mounted onto a wall that will serve as the ritual window. In front of it, the user must draw a pentagram in chalk and recite:
                            "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgahnagl fhtagn."
                            What appears beyond the crystal cannot be chosen and is often as revealing as it is dangerous—for the beings dwelling on the far side of the window can also see the user. If drawn to them, they may attempt to cross.
                            To use the crystal is not merely to observe, but to invoke the gaze from the other side.
                            For this reason, it has been used as an interdimensional surveillance tool or a medium for contacting entities from beyond the void. But beware: once the channel is opened, it may continue showing you visions—even as you sleep.</p>

                        <h3>Scapular with the Yellow Sign</h3>
                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Yellow Sign.png">
                        <p>The Yellow Sign, emblem of the King in Yellow and the cult of Hastur, acts as a psychic seed implanted in the mind simply by being perceived. No ritual or invocation is needed—merely seeing it is enough.
                            Those exposed to it, whether by accident or intent, begin to experience a subtle yet progressive distortion of reality. Their dreams become tainted with images of the city of Carcosa, where black suns never set and the lake Hali reflects landscapes no man has ever walked.
                            There, always in the distance, rises the silhouette of the King—a figure draped in tattered gold, wearing a mask that never changes expression because it has no face. In truth, he need not be seen with the eyes at all. Simply reading certain works, such as the theatrical play The King in Yellow, is enough to begin perceiving him—in walls, in mirrors, or in dreams.
                            Prolonged contact with the Sign not only disturbs one’s emotional state, but warps the sense of identity, confuses memories, and breaks the boundary between subjective perception and utter madness.
                            Thus, what better ward against the unworthy than a scapular on chest and back, adorned with a symbol that cannot be safely beheld?</p>

                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Powder of Ibn Ghazi.png">
                        <p>Not all of man's enemies are visible. Some hide within the vibrations of other dimensions, while others lurk behind psychic veils that blind our senses. The Dust of Ibn Ghazi is one of the few tools that allow us to tear through that veil. The powder has the power to reveal the invisible. When cast into the air—especially in a place heavy with psychic tension or where the presence of incorporeal entities is suspected—anything concealed will be revealed, even if only partially.
                            However, its effect is as brutal as it is brief. Reality writhes before the eyes of the witness, and what is shown is rarely bearable to the human mind. Using it demands a great deal of cold blood, mental discipline, and the will to confront what should not be seen.

                        <img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Escritorio\Eche\Portfolio\Lovecraftnian Survival Kit\kit images\Saaa Maaa Ritual.png">
                        <p>This is one of the few methods humans possess to defend themselves against the most powerful and terrifying entities. The ritual is not merely vocal; it requires the placement of eight sigils, each with a specific defensive function, which together form a barrier against extradimensional influences—known as the Pentacle of the Planes.
                            If performed correctly, it not only stabilizes the area of conjuration but also maintains dimensional coherence during dangerous summonings.
                            It is rumored that there exists a final line to the chant that grants absolute protection, but no human knows it, as it is cryptically referenced in the grimoire known as The Revelations of Gla'aki.
                            Preparation must be precise—any error in the intonation, the arrangement of the pentacle, or the placement of the sigils can prove fatal.</p>
